# Leaf

Mainly a place to store data like a Maven repository since I don't have one, nor do I know how to set up one.
Also hosts scripts to automatically generate certain manifests based on Steam depot data.

# Scripts

To use the scripts, extract the manifests via [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader) and pass the absolute path to the manifest as an arg.
